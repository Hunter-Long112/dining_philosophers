# dining-philosophers

The c code in this repository entitled assign4-part2 and assign4-part3 are my solutions to a version of 
the "Dining Philosophers" problem originally proposed by the famous computer scientist, Dr. Dijkstra, and
proposed to me when I took operating systems (CS-3733) at UTSA. The two short bash scripts included were 
my way of testing them more effiecinetly so I decided they would be worth uploading as well. Below, I 
will eloborate on the dining philosophers problem as it was explained to me, and briefly describe how I 
compile and run these programs. 

THE PROBLEM AS IT WAS DESCRIBED TO ME:
The first part of this assignment was to use pthread_create() to create a number of threads based on 
a number passed in as a command line arguement. 

HOW I COMPILE, RUN, AND TEST THESE PROGRAMS:
